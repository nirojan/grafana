// 1. Caller has some resource/JSON that they THINK is of a known family/kind.
//    (Yes, this covers everything. The existence of canonical schema/this package
//    entails that some JSON can only be called "a dashboard" if it conforms to
//    these schemas.)
// 2. Caller picks a family to validate against based on what kind of resource they
//    think they have, and how universally they want to/can validate, and attempts to
//    Validate. Validation will have a top-level method, also broken down into smaller methods.
// 3. Successful validation returns an Resource, failure an informative error. (Errors will
//    wrap lower-level errors, particularly CUE ones, to make sense, and will be specific
//    to each family.)
// 4. The Resource then has a few operations available:
//    - migrate to some newer schema, if a migration exists for its found schema
//    - strip defaults
//    - apply defaults
//    - marshal to concrete representation (JSON)

// To construct the set of builtin family objects, we need to provide concrete paths
// that correspond to certain known file locations. Not all of these concrete paths
// will be knowable, depending on the context in which this package is loaded. So,
// it's the sole responsibility of this package to define the mold into which
// we pour specific knowledge about a loaded filesystem. (We can't even
// enumerate those kinds here...we could try to break that with bindata, but
// that seems inadvisable.)
